# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?) 

We built a functioning romcom website that has functioning buttons and actions that apply to the websites functionality for users to generate, create, save and view covers of romance novels. It solves this problem by offering an interactive interface that enables users to easily manipulate book cover elements, ultimately allowing them to produce personalized book covers. It's a solution for anyone  interested in creating book cover mock-ups.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?) 

Clone the repository, navigate into the project directory, open the project in a browser

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

I thought the ability the create your own cover was cool: https://imgur.com/a/Ts8aXUO

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?) 

This is week 2 of mod 1. I would say this project took a good amount of time after class and through the weekend. We had about a week to get it finished.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

Learning goals of this project were to gain understanding of the code we were implementing on this faux website as well as experiencing collaboration and how we both as partners work together to learn new code and how to apply it with JavaScript.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

1st win is getting iteration 0-4 done! Big ups on getting it completed.
2nd win was having a good partner going into this. Though we both don't fully get how some of the code works we understand the principle as well as the end goal of what each feature should be doing and behaving like.
3rd win learning how to lean into my resources for guidance as well as gaining better traction on self learning.
Challenges faced were having to learn new JavaScript you can't full wrap your head around and then applying it right after. As well as the ability to speak to it and explain it to others to make it make sense.
